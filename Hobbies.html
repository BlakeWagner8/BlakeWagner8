						One of Blake's greatest passions is traveling. He has been to many different big cities in the United States including Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, but the greatest place he has been is Hawaii. 
						He has been out of the country twice to Cancun, Mexico and Vancouver, Canada. In the summer of 2020 he planned on going on a school trip to Europe which included London, Paris, the Alps, and Munich. This
						trip was unfortunately cancelled due to coronavirus. However, the trip is still paid for and being rescheduled and he plans to go during the summer of 2022.

						From age 9 Blake began playing basketball and continued until his senior year of high school. Although he did not play for his high school team, he played for a couple of AAU select teams including the
						Kentucky Maulers in middle school and the Kentucky Cobras in high school. However, he mostly enjoyed just playing for fun and played for a number of recreational teams. He also played baseball at a younger 
						age, but as he got older he preferred playing basketball and sowly grew out of it.
						<br />
						<br />
						Not only did Blake play sports, but he is also a big fan of watching sports. He grew up in a family of UK and Bengals fans. Basketball is the sport he enjoys watching the most. His favorite NBA player
						is Devin Booker, who went to UK, and he also likes the Oklahoma City Thunder. He also enjoys watching football, soccer, and olympic sports when they are on TV.
